# qTranslate (fixed version)
A fork of qTranslate by Quan Qin ==> http://www.qianqin.de/qtranslate/

# Fixes
Fixes made to the original qTranslate version: 2.5.39 are as follows: 
* fixing broken 404s
* fixing broken visual text editor in the back-end
* adding support for WordPress 4.2.1 and above (hopefully)

# Support 
I (Archie Makuwa - https://github.com/Archie22is) have noticed that there are plenty of forked and well 
supported qTranslate plugins on Github and on the WordPress plugins page. You are more than welcome to 
contribute to this version, fork or enhance the plugin but I or Struto will not be offering any support 
or answering any questions or issues encounted with the plugin
